# Introduction

It is becoming more commonplace to install front end proxy devices in
front of DNS servers {{!RFC1035}} to provide (for example) load
balancing or to perform transport layer conversions.

This has the unfortunate side effect of hiding the clients' source IP
addresses from the server, making it harder to employ server-side
technologies that rely on knowing those address (e.g. ACLs, DNS Response
Rate Limiting, etc).

This document defines an option within the EDNS(0) Extension Mechanism
for DNS {{!RFC6891}} that allows a DNS server to receive
the original client source IP address when supplied by trusted proxies.

This specification is only intended for use on server-side proxy devices
that are under the same administrative control as the DNS servers
themselves.  As such there is no change in the scope within which any
private information might be shared.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" {{!RFC2119}}.

# Description

## EDNS Option Format

This protocol uses an EDNS(0) {{!RFC6891}} option to include the original
client source IP address in proxied DNS messages. The option is structured as
follows:

                 +0 (MSB)                            +1 (LSB)
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    0: |                          OPTION-CODE                          |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    2: |                         OPTION-LENGTH                         |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    4: |                            FAMILY                             |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    6: |                           ADDRESS...                          /
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

* (Defined in {{!RFC6891}}) OPTION-CODE, 2 octets, for XPF is TBD (0xXX 0xXX).

* (Defined in {{!RFC6891}}) OPTION-LENGTH, 2 octets, contains the length of the
payload (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets.

* FAMILY, 2 octets, indicates the family of the address contained in the
option, using address family codes as assigned by IANA in Address Family
Numbers {{Address_Family_Numbers}}.

The format of the address part depends on the value of FAMILY.  This document
only defines the format for FAMILY 1 (IPv4) and FAMILY 2 (IPv6), which are as
follows:

* ADDRESS, a fixed number of octets, contains either an IPv4 or IPv6 address,
depending on FAMILY. For FAMILY 1 (IPv4), the ADDRESS field is 4 octets. For
FAMILY 2 (IPv4), the ADDRESS field is 16 octets.

All fields are in network byte order ("big-endian", per {{!RFC1700}}, Data
Notations).

##  Proxy Processing

Proxies MUST append this option to each request packet received before
forwarding it to the intended DNS server.

If this option is already present in an incoming request it MUST be
stripped from the request unless the request was received from an
upstream proxy that is white-listed by the receiving proxy, in which
case the original value of the option MUST be preserved.

If the proxy has to create a new OPT RR (because none was present in the
original request) it MUST strip any OPT RR subsequently seen in the
response for conformance with Section 7 of {{!RFC6891}}.

Author's note: what are the implications of the above for TSIG {{tsig}}?

##  Server Processing

This option MUST be ignored by servers when received from a client that
is not white-listed by the server.

When this option is received from a white-listed proxy, the DNS server
MUST (SHOULD?) use the address from the option contained therein in
preference to the client's source IP address for any data processing
logic that would otherwise depend on the latter.

If the length of the client IP address contained in the OPTION-DATA is
not consistent with that expected for the given IP version then the
server MUST return a FORMERR response.

Author's note: What response for unknown IP version numbers?

Servers MUST NOT send this option in DNS responses.

##Â  Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS (TSIG) {#tsig}

The considerations for TSIG {{!RFC2845}} from Section 4.5 of "DNS Proxy
Implementation Guidelines" {{!RFC5625}} apply here.

A TSIG-signed request MUST either:

1.  be forwarded according to RFC 5625 without addition of this option,
or

2.  be verified using a secret shared between client and proxy, updated
with this option, and then re-signed with a (potentially different)
shared secret before sending to the server.

In the case of option 1, the server might still be able to uniquely
identify and authenticate the client through its shared key, but not by
its IP address.

If option 2 is used, there is an operational trade-off to be considered
as to whether the two secrets (between client and proxy, and between
proxy and server) are actually the same secret.  A potential advantage
of three-way sharing of the secret is that the server response (which
per above MUST NOT be modified by adding this option) may be returned
directly to the client without any further TSIG operations.

Author's note: A third alternative exists, which is to append an
additional TSIG signature to the packet based on a secret shared only
between the proxy and server.  If end-to-end TSIG validation is required
alongside TSIG validation between proxy and server, the server would
have to 1) validate that second signature, 2) strip it, and then 3)
perform further validation on the original signature.  Feedback is
sought on whether this is worth pursuing.

##  Multi-tier Proxies

TBD

# Security Considerations {#security}

If the white-list of trusted proxies is implemented as a list of IP
addresses, the server administrator MUST have the ability to selectively
disable this feature for any transport where there is a possibility of
the proxy's source address being spoofed.

This does not mean to imply that use over UDP is impossible - if for
example the network architecture keeps all proxy-to-server traffic on a
dedicated network and clients have no direct access to the servers then
the proxies' source addresses can be considered unspoofable.

# Privacy Considerations

Used incorrectly, this option could expose internal network information,
however it is not intended for use on proxy / forwarder devices that sit
on the client-side of a DNS request.

# IANA Considerations

IANA are directed to assign the value TBD for the XPF option
in the DNS EDNS0 Option Codes Registry.
